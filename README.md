Mathematical Card Tricks Simulation

In this project, I developed a Python-based simulation to demonstrate the mathematical logic behind card tricks, inspired by Martin Gardner's "Mathematics, Magic and Mystery." I created a Python library for card-related functions and implemented two renowned card tricks utilizing the Chinese Remainder Theorem and basic algebra. This project showcases the hidden math behind card tricks, making them intuitive and educational, and is ideal for programming assignments.
